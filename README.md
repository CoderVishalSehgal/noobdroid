Do check our website - noobdroid.com in order to follow up on our progress so far.

noobdroid.com is a tech blog that aims to help beginners learn Android Development faster.
The website is for and by the students of the Google-Udacity Android Scholarship Program. The website will aim to provide a way for both beginner & advanced coders to be up and coding in Android in relatively short spans of time (through pseudocode methods using custom boilerplate code).
This will be an open-source project but we will follow a certain structure while taking contributions. Please check out the following set of points to keep in mind while making your contribution.

The website is currently being run using Wordpress Themes (OceanWP theme) but ideally we would like to change to HTML, CSS and JS.

How to contribute?
This is a project that keeps in mind the varying interests and expertise level of the different members of the community. But one common goal for the community is learning Android. So, every single member, no matter the experience or level, can contribute in making tutorials for the different topics in Android.
