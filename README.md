Do check our website - noobdroid.com in order to follow up on our progress so far.

noobdroid.com is a tech blog that aims to help beginners learn Android Development faster. This will be an open-source project but we will follow a certain structure while taking contributions. Please check out the following set of points to keep in mind while making your contribution.

The website is currently being run using Wordpress Themes (OceanWP theme) but ideally we would like to change to HTML, CSS and JS.

Point #1:
We will use version control (GitHub) as our workflow model. Any changes to be made should be made on a separate branch.

Point #2:
Branch should be named (e.g.)'Feature: ViewGroup Tutorial (by Member #05)'

Point #3:
As soon as you make a contribution, drop me an email @ashwanth1109@gmail.com or a message on slack @Ashwanth so that I can revert back immediately.
