Check the website first if you haven't.

The website is currently being run using Wordpress Themes (screenr theme with several plugins) but ideally we would like to change to HTML, CSS and JS (a template is already in the pipeline for this).

noobdroid.com is a tech blog that aims to help beginners learn Android Development faster.
The website is for and by the students of the Google-Udacity Android Scholarship Program. The website will aim to provide a way for both beginner & advanced coders to be coding in Android in short time spans (through pseudocode methods using custom boilerplate code).
This will be an open-source project but we will follow a certain structure while taking contributions. 

Who can contribute?
This is a project that keeps in mind the varying interests and expertise level of the different members of the community. But one common goal for the community is learning Android. So, every single member, no matter the experience or level, can contribute in making tutorials for the different topics in Android.

How to contribute?
We will have 6 groups of contributors -

1) DESIGN - you will work on the ui/ux portion of the website. Collaborate with others to find a common design solution that fits everyone's needs.

2) WORDPRESS - you will work on updating content that is provided using a WordPress dashboard. You will be using the same design template but modifying only the content.

3) CONTENT - you will work on creating content in the form of cheat-codes, conceptuals, guides & tutorials for different concepts in Android - from beginner to advanced.

4) FLUTTER - you will work on the brainstorming for the flutter section of the website. Working on this would require you to take complete responsibility to making this section a reality with others in the group.

5) WEBSITE - you will work on creating the website using HTML, CSS & JS. This role might require you to be familiar with these languages.

6)ADMIN - you will work with other members in your group to coordinate with the different groups and ensure that things are progressing. If you have a strong tendancy for management, then this role might be apt for you.

Note that if you're interested in learning something, lets say Wordpress and you have no experience, you can still join the Wordpress group to learn things on the fly. If you're confused about any of these roles and require more clarity, give me a shout @

Once you've decided which groups you'd like to work with, complete the following steps:

Point #1:
We will use version control (GitHub) as our workflow model. Any changes to be made should be made on a separate branch. Branch should be named (e.g.)'Feature: ViewGroup Tutorial (by Member #05)'
