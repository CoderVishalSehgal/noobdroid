noobdroid.com is a tech blog that aims to help beginners learn Android Development faster. This will be an open-source project but we will follow a certain structure while taking contributions.

Rule #1:
We will use version control (GitHub) as our workflow model. Any changes to be made should be made on a separate branch.

Rule #2:
Branch should be named 'Feature #XX - ViewGroup Tutorial (by member #XX)'

Rule #3:
As soon as you make a contribution, drop me an email @ ashwanth1109@gmail.com or
